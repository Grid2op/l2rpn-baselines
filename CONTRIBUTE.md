# Contribute to L2RPN_Baselines

This document is a handbook to writing a new baseline.

We provide this guide and a [Template baseline](/l2rpn_baselines/Template) to help you getting started.

# One baseline, one submodule
As shown by the [Template baseline](/l2rpn_baselines/Template), it is expected from baselines to take the form a python submodule
```bash
tree ./l2rpn_baselines/MyContrib/


./l2rpn_baselines/MyContrib/
├── evaluate.py
├── __init__.py
├── MyContrib.py
├── MyContrib.md
└── train.py

0 directories, 5 files
```

# Submodule requirements

## MyContrib\/\_\_init\_\_.py
In the `__init__.py` file, is used to export the entry points of your baseline.

You MUST export the following entry points in the \_\_init\_\_.py file:

- `MyContrib` [**required**] :
   The class of your baseline, implementing `grid2op.Agent.BaseAgent` or `grid2op.Agent.AgentWithConverter`
- `MyContrib.evaluate` [**required**] :
   the `evaluate` function as described in the next section
- `MyContrib.train` [**optional**]:
   the `train` function as described in the second-next section

```python
__all__ = [
    "MyContrib",
    "evaluate",
    "train"
]

from l2rpn_baselines.MyContrib.MyContrib import MyContrib
from l2rpn_baselines.MyContrib.evaluate import evaluate
from l2rpn_baselines.MyContrib.train import train
```

As it is [pythonic](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#intra-package-references) and less error prone, the exports MUST be absolute. That is, as part of this package all imports from within this package MUST import from the root of `l2rpn_baselines` as showcased above. 

## MyContrib.evaluate

This is the exported name of a function used to evaluate the performances of your baseline.

The function MUST respect the signature provided below.

We recommend using the runner and placing this function in a separate file.

```python
def evaluate(env,
             load_path=".",
             logs_path=None,
             nb_episode=1,
             nb_process=1,
             max_steps=-1,
             verbose=False,
             save_gif=False,
             **kwargs)
```

However, you CAN change the default values of the arguments.

 - env:`grid2op.Environment.Environment` The environment on which the baseline will be evaluated.
 - load_path: `str` The path where the model is stored. This is used by the agent when calling `agent.load`
 - logs_path: `str` The path where the agents results will be stored.
 - nb_episode: `int` Number of episodes to run for the assessment of the performance.
 - nb_process: `int` Number of process to be used for the assessment of the performance.
 - max_steps: `int` Maximum number of timestep each episode can last. It should be a positive integer or -1.
        -1 means that the entire episode is run (until the chronics is out of data or until a game over).
 - verbose: `bool` verbosity of the output
 - save_gif: `bool` Whether or not to save a gif into each episode folder corresponding to the representation of the said episode.
 - kwargs: Other key words arguments that you are free to use.

## MyContrib.train (optional)
  
This is the exported name of a function used to train your baseline.

If you choose to provide it, the function MUST respect the signature provided below. 

We also recommend placing this function in a separate file.

```python
def train(env,
          name="MyContrib",
          iterations=1,
          save_path=None,
          load_path=None,
          **kwargs)
```
However, you CAN change the default values of the arguments.

 - env: `grid2op.Environment.Environment` The environmnent on which the baseline will be trained
 - name: `str` Fancy name you give to this baseline.
 - iterations: `int` Number of training iterations to perform
 - save_path: `str` The path where the baseline will be saved during / at the end of the training.
 - load_path: ``str`` Path where to look for reloading the model. Use ``None`` if no model should be loaded.
 - kwargs: Other key-word arguments that you might use for training.

## MyContrib\/MyContrib.md (optional)

It is encouraged to provide a markdown file at the root of your baseline submodule containing:

 - The authors names
 - A contact email address
 - Some information on the baseline's performances
 - A reference to a paper (if applicable)
 - Training time (if applicable)
 - Training enviroment (if applicable)
 - Number of training iterations (if applicable)
 - Values of hyperparameters (if applicable)
 - Any other information worth mentionning


# Submit your baseline
Once all of the above have been performed, the best way to submit a new baseline is to open a pull request on the 
github repository of this package [l2rpn-baselines](https://github.com/rte-france/l2rpn-baselines) showing your code included in the l2rpn_baselines package.

Note that before acceptance, your baselines will be checked by RTE teams. In order to ease the review process, it is
recommended that all of the above steps have been carefully respected, in particular the input / outputs and names
of each function mentionned in this document.

A study of the open source licenses you used will also be carried out. To ease this process, we recommand you to
post your baseline under one of the following license:
- Apache
- MIT
- BSD clause 2
- BSD clause 3 
- MPL v2.0

**NB** we are aware these licenses are pretty permissive. If you want to disclose only part of your baseline, for 
example only the evaluation part, but without giving others access to the training code in a license and use a
different license for the part when you train, it might be possible to post two different baselines. This is not
recommended.
